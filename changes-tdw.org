* Change "post_form" method to "post"
  
  The following error was encountered on Monday, August 12, 2013 using Google::Voice version 0.05:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Can't locate object method "post_form" via package "Mojo::UserAgent" at /home/troy/perl5/lib/perl5/Google/Voice.pm line 41.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  "post_form" is an obsolete method. See http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/UserAgent#post for post examples:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
    my $tx = $ua->post('example.com');
    my $tx = $ua->post('http://example.com' => {DNT => 1} => 'Hi!');
    my $tx = $ua->post(
        'http://example.com' => {DNT => 1} => form => {a => 'b'});
    my $tx = $ua->post(
        'http://example.com' => {DNT => 1} => json => {a => 'b'});
  #+END_SRC

  Here's the line in Voice.pm that causes the errors:
  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
    $c->post_form(
        'https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin',
        {   Email  => $user,
            Passwd => $pass,
            GALX   => $galx,
        }
    );
  #+END_SRC

  And here's the modified line:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl :tangle patch01.pl
    $c->post(
        'https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin' => form =>
        {   Email  => $user,
            Passwd => $pass,
            GALX   => $galx,
        }
    );
  #+END_SRC
* Change post_form method in send_sms

  Here's the line in Voice.pm that causes the errors:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
    my $json = $c->post_form(
        'https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/sms/send',
        {   id          => undef,
            phoneNumber => $phone,
            text        => $content || '',
            _rnr_se     => $self->rnr_se
        }
    )->res->json;
  #+END_SRC

  And here's the fix:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC perl :tangle patch02.pl
    my $json = $c->post(
        'https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/sms/send' => form => 
        {   id          => undef,
            phoneNumber => $phone,
            text        => $content || '',
            _rnr_se     => $self->rnr_se
        }
    )->res->json;
  #+END_SRC
